# Task 09: Transfer Token

## Workflow
1.  **Collect Tokens**: Aggregates a list of potential tokens for transfer, including:
    *   System Tokens (`PathUSD`, `AlphaUSD`).
    *   User-created stablecoins from `tempo.db`.
2.  **Find Balance**: Randomly checks up to 5 tokens from the list to find one with a positive balance.
3.  **Recipient**: Generates a random Ethereum address as the recipient.
4.  **Transfer**: Submits a `transfer` transaction for a random amount between **10** and **50** units (or 50% of balance if insufficient).
5.  **Gas Management**: Uses `GasManager` with a 5.0x multiplier to ensure the transaction is prioritized.

## Technical Details
*   **Implementation**: `chains/tempo/src/tasks/t09_transfer_token.rs`
*   **Target**: Random recipient address.
*   **Fallback**: If no random token has balance, it forces a check on `PathUSD` as a fallback.

## How to Debug
Run this specific task with a selected wallet:
```bash
cargo run --bin debug_task -- --task 9 --wallet 0
```

## Success Criteria
*   Transaction hash generated for `transfer` call.
*   Successfully identified a token with balance.
*   Zero compilation warnings.
