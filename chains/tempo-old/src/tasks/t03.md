# Task 03: Send Token

## Workflow
This task verifies the transfer of ERC20 tokens (specifically `PathUSD`) on the Tempo chain. It ensures that standard ERC20 operations like `balanceOf` and `transfer` are functioning correctly.

### Steps
1.  **Initialize**: Connects to the `PathUSD` contract (hardcoded to `0x20C0...0000`).
2.  **Check Balance**: Queries the wallet's token balance.
    *   If the balance is below the minimum threshold (10^12 wei), the task aborts to preserve funds or report insufficient balance.
3.  **Select Recipient**: Generates a random destination address (`Address::random()`) to simulate a real-world transfer scenario.
4.  **Determine Amount**: Randomly calculates a transfer amount between 0.01 and 0.1 tokens (10^16 to 10^17 wei).
5.  **Send**: Executes the `transfer` transaction.
6.  **Verify**: Log the transaction hash. Success is assumed if the transaction is submitted; the task does not wait for block confirmation to maximize throughput.

## Technical Details
*   **Implementation**: `chains/tempo/src/tasks/t03_send_token.rs`
*   **Struct**: `SendTokenTask`
*   **Token**: `PathUSD` (0x20C0000000000000000000000000000000000000)
*   **Randomness**: Uses `rand::Rng` for both recipient address and amount generation.
*   **Safety**: Includes checks to ensure the transfer amount does not exceed the wallet's balance.

## How to Debug
Run this specific task with a selected wallet:
```bash
cargo run --bin debug_task -- --task 3 --wallet 0
```
