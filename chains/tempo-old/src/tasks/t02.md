# Task 02: Claim Faucet

## Workflow
This task funds the wallet using Tempo's custom RPC faucet method. It is essential for ensuring wallets have enough native currency (Method or equivalent) to pay for transaction gas in subsequent tasks.

### Steps
1.  **Request**: Sends a JSON-RPC request to the provider using the method `tempo_fundAddress`.
2.  **Parameters**: Passes the wallet's address as the single parameter `[address]`.
3.  **Response Handling**: 
    *   Expects a JSON response containing a transaction hash or a list of hashes (if multiple funding transactions were triggered).
    *   Parses the response to extract the first transaction hash.
4.  **Verification**: 
    *   If a hash is returned, it implies the faucet request was accepted and broadcast.
    *   If the response is empty or null, the task reports failure (likely due to rate limiting).

## Technical Details
*   **Implementation**: `chains/tempo/src/tasks/t02_claim_faucet.rs`
*   **Struct**: `ClaimFaucetTask`
*   **RPC Method**: `tempo_fundAddress`
*   **Note**: This effectively bypasses the need for a web-based CAPTCHA faucet for automated testing.

## How to Debug
Run this specific task with a selected wallet:
```bash
cargo run --bin debug_task -- --task 2 --wallet 0
```
