# Task 01: Deploy Contract

## Workflow
This task verifies the basic smart contract deployment capability on the Tempo chain. It is foundational for verifying that the wallet has funds and can interact with the chain.

### Steps
1.  **Compile**: Reads `contracts/Counter.sol` and compiles it using `ContractCompiler`. If the compiler is not found, it falls back to a mock bytecode.
2.  **Estimate Gas**: Queries the current gas price from the provider and applies a "bump" factor using `GasManager` to ensure quick inclusion.
3.  **Deploy**: Constructs a deployment transaction with the contract bytecode and signs it using the task's wallet.
4.  **Submit**: Sends the signed transaction to the network.
5.  **Result**: The task considers the operation successful once the transaction hash is returned (entering the mempool), without waiting for full confirmation.

## Technical Details
*   **Implementation**: `chains/tempo/src/tasks/t01_deploy_contract.rs`
*   **Struct**: `DeployContractTask`
*   **Key Utilities**: 
    *   `ContractCompiler`: Handles Solidity compilation.
    *   `GasManager`: Handles gas estimation and priority fees.
    *   `SignerMiddleware`: Manages transaction signing.

## How to Debug
Run this specific task with a selected wallet:
```bash
cargo run --bin debug_task -- --task 1 --wallet 0
```
