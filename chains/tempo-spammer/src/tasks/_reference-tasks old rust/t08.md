# Task 08: Burn Stablecoin

## Workflow
1.  **Retrieve Assets**: Queries `tempo.db` (table `created_assets`) for stablecoins previously created by the current wallet.
2.  **Find Balance**: Iterates through the retrieved assets to find the first one with a positive balance in the wallet.
3.  **Burn**: Submits a `burn` transaction for a random amount between **1** and **5** tokens (adjusted for decimals).
4.  **Gas Management**: Uses `GasManager` with a 5.0x multiplier to ensure the transaction is prioritized.

## Technical Details
*   **Implementation**: `chains/tempo/src/tasks/t08_burn_stable.rs`
*   **Target**: The selected wallet's own address.
*   **Validation**: Confirmation of balance reduction is implicit in the transaction success.

## How to Debug
Run this specific task with a selected wallet:
```bash
cargo run --bin debug_task -- --task 8 --wallet 0
```

## Success Criteria
*   Transaction hash generated for `burn` call.
*   Successfully identified a token with balance.
*   Zero compilation warnings.
