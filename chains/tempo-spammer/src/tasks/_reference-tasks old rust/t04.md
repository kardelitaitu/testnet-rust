# Task 04: Create Stablecoin

## Workflow
This task deploys a new ERC20 Stablecoin using the `TIP20Factory` and mints an initial supply. The "Fire and Forget" pattern is used for the minting step to optimize performance.

### Steps
1.  **Configuration**: Uses `TIP20Factory` (`0x20FC...`) and Quote Token (`PathUSD`).
2.  **Generate**: Creates random "Name" and "Symbol" strings (e.g., "OmegaCash", "OUSD").
3.  **Deploy**: Calls `factory.createToken` with a unique salt.
    *   Waits for transaction inclusion.
    *   Parses logs for the `TokenCreated` event to retrieve the new address.
4.  **Mint**:
    *   Connects to the new token (as `ITIP20Mintable`).
    *   Grants `ISSUER_ROLE`.
    *   Submits a mint transaction for 100,000 tokens.
    *   **Optimization**: Does NOT wait for the mint receipt (Fire and Forget) to reduce blocking time.
5.  **Persist**: Logs the new token details (Address, Symbol, Name) to `tempo.db`.

## Technical Details
*   **Implementation**: `chains/tempo/src/tasks/t04_create_stable.rs`
*   **Key Insight**: Waiting for the mint receipt is unnecessary for subsequent tasks as long as the nonce is managed correctly.
*   **Output**: `tempo.db` table `created_assets`.
