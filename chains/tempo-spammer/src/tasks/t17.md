# Task 17: Batch EIP-7702

## Workflow
Balance Check & Auto-Funding (Self-Healing)
The task first queries the wallet's PathUSD balance.
Condition: It requires at least 0.1 PathUSD (10,000,000 wei) to proceed.
Action: If the balance is insufficient, it automatically Mints 2,000 PathUSD to the wallet and waits for the transaction to confirm.
Step 1: Token Approval
It constructs an 
approve
 transaction for PathUSD.
Target: The Stablecoin DEX contract.
Amount: Approves 1,000 PathUSD (1,000,000,000 wei) to be spent by the DEX.
This ensures the subsequent swap transaction will not revert due to allowance limits.
Step 2: Batch Swap Execution
It immediately executes a swap transaction on the DEX.
Action: Swaps 1,000 PathUSD for AlphaUSD.
Slippage Protection: Calculates a minimum output amount of 80% (20% slippage tolerance) to prevent front-running or high volatility failures.
This verifies that the system can handle dependent sequential operations (Approval followed immediately by Usage) typical of batch transactions.
