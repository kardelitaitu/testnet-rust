# Task 16: Mint Random NFT

## Workflow
1. Query database for NFT collections owned by wallet.
2. Randomly select one NFT collection from the available collections.
3. Generate random number of NFTs to mint (1-5).
4. Mint the specified number of NFTs to the wallet from the selected collection.
5. Report minting results.

## Success Criteria
✅ **Collection Selection**: Randomly picks from available NFT collections
✅ **Random Minting**: Mints 1-5 NFTs in sequence  
✅ **Transaction Success**: Reports successful mints and transaction hashes
✅ **Error Handling**: Continues even if individual mints fail

## Inputs
- Database connection (from context)
- Wallet address (from context)
- NFT collections (queried from database)
- Random mint quantity (1-5 units)

## Outputs
- Number of NFTs minted successfully
- Selected collection address
- Transaction hash for first successful mint
- Total NFTs attempted

## Notes
- **Database-Driven**: Uses `get_assets_by_type("nft")` from database
- **Random Selection**: Uses cryptographically secure random selection
- **Batch Minting**: Efficiently mints multiple NFTs in one task
- **Error Resilience**: Continues execution even if individual mints fail
- **500ms Delay**: Small delay between mints to avoid nonce conflicts
