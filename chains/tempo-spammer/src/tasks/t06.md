# Task 06: Add Liquidity (Stablecoin DEX)

## Workflow
1.  **Retrieve Assets**: Queries `tempo.db` (table `created_assets`) for stablecoins previously created by the current wallet.
2.  **Select Asset**: Randomly selects one of the retrieved stablecoins to use as the "Base" token.
3.  **Check Pair**: Queries the `IStablecoinDEX` to see if a trading pair exists between the selected Base token and `PathUSD` (Quote token).
4.  **Create Pair (If Needed)**: If no pair exists, calls `createPair` on the DEX.
5.  **Allowance & Balance**:
    *   Checks the wallet's balance of the Base token (must be > 0).
    *   Ensures the DEX has a sufficient allowance to spend the Base token.
6.  **Place Order**: Submits a `place` (Limit Order) transaction to the DEX:
    *   **Side**: Sell (Ask).
    *   **Amount**: 50% of the wallet's Base token balance.
    *   **Price**: Fixed at Tick 100 for testnet consistency.
7.  **Persist**: The order details and transaction hash are logged to the console and task metrics.

## Technical Details
*   **Implementation**: `chains/tempo/src/tasks/t06_add_liquidity.rs`
*   **DEX Interface**: `place(address token, uint128 amount, bool isBid, int16 tick)`
*   **Gas Management**: Uses `GasManager` with a 5.0x multiplier to ensure transactions are prioritized.

## How to Debug
Run this specific task with a selected wallet:
```bash
cargo run --bin debug_task -- --task 6 --wallet 0
```

## Success Criteria
*   Transaction hash generated for `place` call.
*   Confirmation that the pair exists or was created.
*   Zero compilation warnings.
